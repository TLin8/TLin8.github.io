                <h2>SproutfulAI: Gamifying Mental Wellness</h2>
                <p>SproutfulAI emerged from a half-day hackathon focused on mental health improvement. Our team of four
                    recognized the need for more engaging approaches to mental well-being, leading us to develop this
                    AI-powered app to gamify breathing exercises. Users engage in unique exercises with each login,
                    while
                    the rewarding feature of watering a virtual sprout incentivizes regular practice. With a sleek
                    design
                    and interactive elements, SproutfulAI offers a fun and effective solution for enhancing mental
                    wellness
                    in a short time frame.</p>

                <h2>Design Lead: Crafting Engaging Interfaces</h2>
                <p>As the design lead, I led the creation of mockups using Figma, with a focus on crafting a
                    user-centric
                    interface that prioritized engagement and aesthetic appeal. I collaborated closely with team
                    members,
                    actively listening to feedback and critiques to iterate on the design, ensuring its effectiveness in
                    promoting mental well-being. Additionally, I played a crucial role in integrating the OpenAI API to
                    provide more personalized and unique breathing exercises, thereby enhancing the overall
                    functionality of
                    the app.</p>

                <p>After thorough research and ideation, we transitioned into the design phase. Utilizing Figma, I
                    crafted
                    mockups for my teammates to use as a guide during the development phase. This collaborative process
                    facilitated a seamless transition from design to code, resulting in a functional project that
                    reflected
                    our shared vision.</p>

                <h2>Hackathon Success: Validating Impactful Solutions</h2>
                <p>After the hackathon, our team was chosen as one of the winners, which ultimately validated our
                    ability to
                    deliver impactful solutions under tight deadlines. This project provided us with invaluable insights
                    into effective teamwork and time management. Moving forward, our roadmap includes implementing
                    further
                    enhancements, such as user authentication and calendar pages to keep track of users' completed days.
                    Overall, we aim to enhance user engagement and continue focusing on making a difference in mental
                    wellness.</p>

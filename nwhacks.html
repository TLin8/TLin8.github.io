                <h2>Developing a Skill Exchange App</h2>
                <p>During the 24-hour nwHacks hackathon at UBC, we developed an app centered around the theme of
                    community. Our app is similar to a dating app like Tinder but with a unique twist: it focuses on
                    skill exchange. Users can search for people looking to exchange skills, creating a platform where
                    they can not only connect with others but also learn new skills from their matches and share their
                    own. This blend of dating and skill-sharing sets our app apart, offering a meaningful way for users
                    to connect and grow.</p>

                <h2>My Role as the UX/UI Designer</h2>
                <p>As the UX/UI designer in my team of four, I participated in the brainstorming stage and devised how
                    users would interact with our app. I created various interface designs to best suit our users'
                    needs. After extensive research on popular dating apps, I incorporated the features I found most
                    enjoyable, ensuring our app was intuitive and user-friendly with a minimalistic approach to avoid
                    clutter. I actively listened to critiques and feedback from my team to iterate on the design.
                    Additionally, I designed an interface that was not too complex, ensuring it could be developed
                    within the hackathon timeframe.</p>

                <h2>Seamless Collaboration in Development</h2>
                <p>After my team had a clear understanding of my interface design, they began coding the backend of the
                    app while I continued crafting mockups on Figma for them to use as a guide during development. This
                    collaboration allowed for a seamless transition from designing our vision to coding the app.</p>

                <h2>Insights Gained from the Hackathon</h2>
                <p>Participating in the hackathon taught me a great deal about effective communication and collaboration
                    within a team. It was a memorable experience, providing me with the opportunity to work with new
                    teammates and learn from the process of building an idea from scratch within a short timeframe.
                    Although we didn't complete our project due to complications and unforeseen challenges, the journey
                    was fascinating and offered valuable insights into the tech environment.</p>
